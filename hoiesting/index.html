      This code snippet is a series of commented and uncommented code blocks.
      Let's go through it step by step: The first commented block of code
      defines a function add using an arrow function syntax. When this function
      is called, it logs the string "hello world" to the console. The next line
      of code logs the value of the variable x to the console. However, since x
      is not defined in this code snippet, it will result in an error. The line
      after that logs the value of the add function to the console. This will
      output the function itself, not the result of calling the function. The
      next commented block of code defines a function add using a regular
      function declaration syntax. It also logs "hello world" to the console
      when called. The line after that declares a variable x and assigns it the
      value 10. The commented block of code after that is similar to the
      previous one, defining a function add and logging its value to the
      console.
